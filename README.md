# cast-gmail
Sync receipts from the CAST gmail to gdrive

This is a minor modification on top of [Gmail2Gdrive](https://github.com/ahochsteger/gmail2gdrive/blob/master/README.md), which handles forwarded attachments (in both English and German) by getting the date from the original message (rather than when it was forwarded). It also includes a simple test script.

For usage information, see [Gmail2Gdrive](https://github.com/ahochsteger/gmail2gdrive/blob/master/README.md).
